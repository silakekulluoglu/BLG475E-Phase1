Note: If there is a vowel, you need to swap it with the letter 2 places after that vowel and you also need to convert it to lowercase if it is uppercase and visa versa. You need to do both. For example if the input is "aS" you need to make it: "Cs", both converting 'a' to 'c' and making it upper from lower . \n    \n    Examples:\n    >>> encode('test')\n    'TGST'\n    >>> encode('This is a message')\n    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n    \"\"\"\n",
